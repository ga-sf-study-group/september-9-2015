Calculate Change

Given a price and amount of money given, write a function calculate_change to calculate the amount of change to return. Return value should be an object/hash with keys of pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, dollar_bills, five_dollar_bills, ten_dollar_bills, and twenty_dollar_bills.

For example, calculate_change(76.89, 100) would return: {pennies: 1, nickels: 0, dimes: 1, quarters: 0, dollar_bills: 3, five_dollar_bills: 0, ten_dollar_bills: 0, twenty_dollar_bills: 1}

Rotate Array

Given an array and number of steps, rotate the array to the right by k steps. 

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

----

Spiral Matrix

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
For example, given the following matrix:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ]
]

Returns [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5].

----

Count Primes

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

----

FizzBuzz

Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 50. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

----

Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

Given a digit string, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. (Check out your cellphone to see the mappings) 

For example, Input: "23", Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

----

Fibonacci

Write a function to print the first n numbers in a fibonacci series. Fibonacci series is series of natural numbers where next number is equivalent to sum of previous two number e.g. fn = fn-1 + fn-2. 
The first 2 numbers in the fibonacci series are always  1, 1.

----

Add Binary

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

For example, a = "11", b = "1", the return is "100".
